# Coffee-Junkie

<b>PROBLEM:</b><br>
The local coffee shop seeks to increase customers coming to the shop and using a website to promote sales.
The coffee shop seeks to enhance their brand with a simple, mobile-first, website that showcases
their coffee. The website is a single-page site consisting of various sections including Home, About, Work, and Contact.

<b>ACTION:</b><br>
To prototype the website, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript was used to quickly create the layout of the website following the site map.
The website follows a mobile-first design scheme, focusing on responsive design.

<b>SOLUTION:</b><br>
The main slider of the Home page showcases a video background. The shop name is displayed with a stylistic, bold font.
The About section features a custom grid display of images and text. To account for mobile devices, the text and images
scale according to the width of the page. The layout for the Our Work section uses the CSS grid to change the layout
depending on the width of the view window. Hover effects are used to indicate clickable objects and a modal is displayed
using JavaScript eventListeners.

<b>Description:</b><br>
Responsive HTML, CSS, JavaScript theme for a local coffee shop.
